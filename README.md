# BTE-Interface
This repository contains the original numerical data used to generate the phonon dispersion curves in our manuscript, which is to be published in Physical Review B (PRB).

# How to Use
To access the data:
1. Navigate to the [Releases](https://github.com/sing0335/BTE-Interface/releases) section.
2. Download and extract the **Figure_Data.zip** archive.
3. The archive contains six files, corresponding to LA and TA phonon dispersion curves along \Gamma--X direction and phonon density of states for Si and Ge:
    * si_LA.disp, si_TA.disp, ge_LA.disp, ge_TA.disp:
      
      These are four data files with phonon dispersion curves for LA and TA branches for both Si and Ge. They correspond to Figure 2 in the manuscript.
      
    * Si_dos.dat, Ge_dos.dat:
      
      These are two data files with phonon density of states for both Si and Ge. They correspond to Figure 3 in the manuscript.
